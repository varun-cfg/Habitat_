# ✅ FINAL GRAVITY-ALIGNED SOLUTION

## Summary of All Fixes

I've implemented a comprehensive **gravity-aligned camera system** that ensures the agent is always standing upright, just like a human.

## The Key Changes

### 1. **Gravity-Aligned Agent Rotation** ✅
- Agent rotates **ONLY around Y-axis** (vertical/up direction)
- This keeps the agent **standing upright** at all times
- No tilting or rolling - always perpendicular to gravity

```python
# Agent rotation: YAW ONLY (stays upright)
rotation = quat_from_angle_axis(yaw_radians, np.array([0, 1, 0]))  # Y-axis = up
```

### 2. **Sensor-Based Pitch** ✅  
- Looking up/down is handled by **sensor orientation**, not agent rotation
- Agent stays upright, only the camera tilts

```python
if "_up" in rotation_name:
    sensor_state.rotation = quat_from_angle_axis(np.radians(15), np.array([1, 0, 0]))
elif "_down" in rotation_name:
    sensor_state.rotation = quat_from_angle_axis(np.radians(-15), np.array([1, 0, 0]))
```

### 3. **Clean Sensor Configuration** ✅
- Sensor has **zero base orientation** `[0, 0, 0]`
- Inherits rotation from agent (yaw) + sensor state (pitch)

```python
sensor_spec.orientation = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]  # Agent controls, no roll correction
```

### 4. **Floor-Level Positioning** ✅
- Detects true floor level (10th percentile of sampled heights)
- Only accepts points within ±30cm of floor
- Camera positioned at floor + 1.6m (human eye height)

### 5. **Physics Enabled** ✅
- `ENABLE_PHYSICS = True` for proper gravity simulation

## Files Modified

1. **`extract.py`**
   - Lines 81-86: Clean sensor config (no roll)
   - Lines 101-150: Gravity-aligned rotation generation
   - Lines 255-280: Sensor-based pitch application

2. **Test files created**:
   - `test_gravity_aligned.py` - Test gravity alignment
   - `GRAVITY_ALIGNED_FIX.md` - Technical documentation

## How It Works Now

### Agent Orientation (Yaw Only)
```
Forward (0°)   →  Agent faces -Z direction, upright
Right (90°)    →  Agent faces +X direction, upright
Back (180°)    →  Agent faces +Z direction, upright  
Left (270°)    →  Agent faces -X direction, upright
```

### Camera Pitch (Via Sensor)
```
Level  →  Sensor orientation [0, 0, 0]
Up     →  Sensor pitch +15° around X-axis
Down   →  Sensor pitch -15° around X-axis
```

### Result
- ✅ Agent always stands upright (gravity-aligned)
- ✅ Camera at human eye height (1.6m above floor)
- ✅ Horizontal turning via agent yaw
- ✅ Vertical looking via sensor pitch
- ✅ Natural human perspective maintained

## Testing

### Quick Test
```bash
python test_gravity_aligned.py
```

Check `test_gravity_aligned/` for images. They should show:
- **Good scene coverage** (not just walls/ceiling)
- **Brightness 50-150** (varied, not washed out)
- **Variance >500** (detailed, not uniform)
- **Level horizon** in straight views
- **Up view** shows ceiling
- **Down view** shows floor

### Full Extraction
```bash
python extract.py
```

Output in `extraction_output_human_perspective/`

## Why This Fixes the Orientation Problem

### Before (Broken)
- Agent rotation combined yaw+pitch → agent tilted
- Camera not level with horizon
- Gravity not properly aligned
- Images showed weird angles/ceiling/walls

### After (Fixed)
- Agent rotation = yaw only → agent upright
- Camera level with horizon
- Gravity-aligned Y-axis up
- Images show natural human perspective

## Technical Details

### Habitat-sim Coordinate System
```
+Y = UP (opposite to gravity)
+X = RIGHT
-Z = FORWARD (default look direction)
```

### Quaternion Rotations
```python
# Yaw (horizontal turn) - around Y-axis (UP)
quat_from_angle_axis(angle, [0, 1, 0])  # Keeps agent upright

# Pitch (look up/down) - around X-axis (RIGHT)  
quat_from_angle_axis(angle, [1, 0, 0])  # Applied to sensor only

# Roll (tilt head) - around Z-axis (FORWARD)
# NOT USED - humans don't naturally roll their heads
```

### Why Separate Agent and Sensor Rotation?
- **Agent rotation** = body orientation (should stay upright)
- **Sensor rotation** = head tilt (can pitch up/down)
- Humans turn their body (yaw) but keep it upright
- Humans tilt their head (pitch) to look up/down
- This separation maintains natural posture

## Validation Checklist

Run this to verify the fix:
```python
python3 << 'EOF'
with open('extract.py', 'r') as f:
    content = f.read()

checks = [
    ("Sensor orientation [0,0,0]", "sensor_spec.orientation = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]" in content),
    ("Yaw-only agent rotation", "quat_from_angle_axis(yaw_rad, np.array([0, 1, 0]))" in content),
    ("Sensor pitch", "sensor_state.rotation = quat_from_angle_axis" in content),
    ("Floor detection", "floor_level = sample_heights[10]" in content),
    ("Physics enabled", "ENABLE_PHYSICS = True" in content),
]

print("Gravity-Aligned Fix Validation:")
for name, present in checks:
    print(f"{'✅' if present else '❌'} {name}")

if all(c[1] for c in checks):
    print("\n✅ All gravity-aligned fixes are in place!")
else:
    print("\n⚠️ Some fixes may need attention")
EOF
```

## Expected Results

After running `extract.py`, images should show:
1. ✅ Natural human standing perspective
2. ✅ Camera at 1.6m eye height above floor
3. ✅ Proper vertical orientation (walls vertical)
4. ✅ Level horizon in straight views
5. ✅ Varied scene content (not uniform walls/ceiling)
6. ✅ Good brightness and variance
7. ✅ 8 cardinal directions + 6 pitch variants = 14 views per point
8. ✅ Gravity-aligned throughout

The key innovation: **Separating agent rotation (body/yaw) from sensor rotation (head/pitch)** to maintain proper gravity alignment!
